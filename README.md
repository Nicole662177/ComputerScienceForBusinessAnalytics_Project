How to use the code:

A version of Python3 is needed. In order to install all necessary modules, package management system PIP is used. 
All of the commands below are for Windows.
To download pip:
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
  python3 get-pip.py
Install scipy:
  python3 -m pip install scipy
Install scikit:
  pip install -U scikit-learn
Install matplotlib:
  python -m pip install -U matplotlib
  
If everything went right, you can run the code from the command line by using the command: python3 PythonApplication1.py
